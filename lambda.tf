  # Terraform you used to create the instance role in week5 (which
  # should be in your "automation" directory) you'll see we did
  # the same thing but instead of the Lambda service it was the EC2
  # service, because in that case it's a VM (managed by EC2) that
  # assumes the role.
  #
  # The "assume role policy" attached to a role doesn't say what
  # the role is allowed to do, it says *who is allowed to use the
  # role*.
  #
  # ALSO NOTE that I'm embedding the "assume role" policy right here,
  # but there are other ways to do it.  For now I just want you to...
  # 1) understand why we need this - we need it to tell AWS that it's
  #    ok for the Lambda service to take on this role when it runs
  #    our Lambda function.
  # 2) see the similarity between this code and the code you have in
  #    the week5 "automation" directory, which does the same thing,
  #    but for the EC2 service instead.
